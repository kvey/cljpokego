  "by: stuartsierra

  Process messages from input in parallel with at most max concurrent
  operations.

  Invokes f on values taken from input channel. f must return a
  channel, whose first value (if not closed) will be put on the output
  channel.

  Returns a channel which will be closed when the input channel is
  closed and all operations have completed.

  Creates new operations lazily: if processing can keep up with input,
  the number of parallel operations may be less than max.

  Note: the order of outputs may not match the order of inputs."
